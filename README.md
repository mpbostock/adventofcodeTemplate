# Advent of Code Template

A standard Kotlin Gradle project for AoC template solutions and tests. This comes with a built in Gradle wrapper, so no need to install Gradle

## Running Tests

Simply run

`./gradlew test` from the command line at the root of the project.

This doesn't output the results of the tests to the command line but will generate test results in html files.

Alternatively, open this in IntelliJ and the tests can be run from there.
